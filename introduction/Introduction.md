# Introducing Signals and Systems

## Continuous-time signals

Continuous signals are represented mathematically by functions which vary
continuously with time.

Sinusoidal signals (e.g. AC) are pretty fundamental in
Electrical Engineering. The mathematical model of a sinusoidal signal is $x(t) =
A \cos (2\pi f_0 t - \phi)$.

## Exercise

Take a moment to think about:

* What is $A$?
* What is $f_0$?
* What is $\phi$?
* What is the period $T_0$ of this signal?

<textarea cols=100 rows=20 placeholder="write your answers here"></textarea>


## Gaining insight using computers

To help us answer these questions, let's use our Mathematical tools to plot a
signal like this and explore it. The example we will use is from *Signals and
Systems for Dummies* (SS4D: page 12):

$$3\cos(2\pi\cdot 2 \cdot t - 3\pi/4)$$


## Wolfram|Alpha

Here's the link: <http://www.wolframalpha.com>

Paste this into the search box

    plot 3 cos(2 pi 2 t - 3 pi/4)


## Matlab

In Matlab we would need to tackle this slightly differently. Here's the code:

```matlab
t = linspace(0, 1, 100);
x = 3 * cos(2*pi*2*t - 3*pi/4);
plot(t,x)
title('A Sinusoidal Signal')
xlabel('Time t (s)')
ylabel('Amplitude')
grid
```

(I will run this code during the live session and we'll import the result into the shared white board.)

## Returning to the Question

What were your answers?

* What is $A$?
* What is $f_0$?
* What is $\phi$?
* What is the period $T_0$ of this signal?

<div class="notes">
<h3>Notes</h3>

* In communications and electronic signal processing, the frequency of
sinusoidal signals us usually given in *cycles per second* or Hz.
* In mathematics, the frequency is always expressed in *radians per second*.
</div>

## Exercises

* Use any or all of the computing tools that you have access to to explore other
sinusoids. Change the values of the variables and explain what happens.
* Try adding sinusoids of different amplitudes and different frequencies
together and see what happens.


## Continuous-time Systems

Systems operate on signals. In mathematical terms, a *system* is a function or
an *operator*, $H\{\}$ that maps the input signal $x(t)$ to an output signal
$y(t)$.

Mathematically we would write this:

$$y(t) = H\{x(t)\}.$$

## Example

An example of a continuous-time system is an electronic amplifier with a gain of
5 and level shift of 2: $y(t) = H\{x(t)\} = 5x(t) + 2$.

In this course, we will model such systems as block diagram models in Simulink.

## Block diagram model in Simulink

![Simulink model of a a continuous-time system](pictures/css.png)

The Simulink code can be downloaded from this file
[gain_level_shift.slx](https://github.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/blob/master/introduction/matlab/gain_level_shift.slx).

## Demonstration

If the input to this system is replaced with a sinewave $x(t)=\sin(t)$ and the output with a scope, what do you think the output will be?

<textarea cols=100 rows=20  placeholder="sketch the waveform here"></textarea>

## Discrete-time Signals

Disrete-time signals are a function of a time index $n$. A discrete-time signal
$x[n]$, unlike a continuous-time signal $x(t)$, is only defined at integer
values of the independent variable $n$. This means that the signal is only
active at specific periods of time. Discrete-time signals can be stored in
computer memory.

## Example

Consider the following simple signal, a pulse sequence:$$x[n] = \left\{
{\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{5,\;0 \le n < 10}\\
{0,\;{\rm{otherwise}}\quad \;}
\end{array}} \right.$$

We can plot this in Matlab as a *stem plot*

----

First define the function $x[n]$

```matlab
% Define the function $x[n]$
function [ y ] = x( n )
  if n < 0 | n >= 10
    y = 0;
  else
    y = 5;
  end
end
```
----

Then set up $n$ and reserve some space for storing $x[n]$

```matlab
% Define sample points
n = -15:18;
% Make space for the signal
xn = zeros(size(n));
```

----

Compute the signal

```matlab
% Compute the signal x[n]
for i = 1:length(xn)
  xn(i) = x(n(i));
end
```
----

Finally, plot the signal as a *stem* (or *lollipop*) plot

```matlab
stem(n,xn)
axis([-15,18,0,6])
title('Stem Plot for a Discrete Signal')
xlabel('Sample n')
ylabel('Signal x[n]')
grid
```
We'll run this code and paste in the resulting plot during the session.

<div class="notes">

The Matlab code is available for download as an m-file
[discrete.m](https://github.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/blob/master/introduction/matlab/discrete.m) which uses function
[x.m](https://github.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/blob/master/introduction/matlab/x.m).

## Exercise

Draw a digital signal that represents your student number in some way. For
example if your number was 765443, then you could generate a signal for which
$x[n] = 0$ when $n < 7$, then $x[n] = 7$ for $7$ periods, then $x[n] = 6$ for
the next 6 periods, $x[n] = 5$ for 5 periods, and so on. The signal should
return to 0 when the last digit has been transmitted.

<textarea cols=100 rows=20  placeholder="sketch the waveform that represents your student number"></textarea>

<div class="notes">To plot this on a computer you would need to transcribe $x[n]$
into an array and then use the "lollipop" plot to plot the data. You could just
create the array by hand, but you could also create a Matlab function if you would
like a challenge.
</div>

## Discrete-time Systems

A discrete-time system, like its continuous-time counterpart, is a function,
$H\{\}$, that maps the input $x[n]$￼ ￼to the output $y[n] = H\{x[n]\}$. An
example of a discrete-time system is the *two-tap* filter:

$$y[n] = H\{x[n]\} = \frac{3}{4}x[n] + \frac{1}{4}x[n-1]$$

The term *tap* denotes that output at time instant $n$ is formed from two time
instants of the input, $n$ and $n – 1$.

----

Check out a block diagram of a two-tap
filter system:

![Block diagram of a two-tap filter system](pictures/ds.png)

This system is available as a Simulink model
[discrete_system.slx](https://github.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/blob/master/introduction/matlab/discrete_system.slx)

<div class="notes">
In words, this system scales the present input by 3/4 and adds it to the past
value of the input scaled by 1/4. The notion of the past input comes about
because ￼$x[n - 1]$ is lagging one sample value behind ￼$x[n]$. The term
*filter* describes the output as an *averaging* of the present input and the
previous input. *Averaging* is a form of filtering.
</div>

# Signal Classifications

## Periodic

Signals that repeat over and over are said to be *periodic*. In mathematical
terms, a signal is periodic if:

* *Continuous signal* $x(t + T) = x(t)$
* *Discrete signal* $x[n + N] = x[n]$

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼<div class="notes">
The smallest $T$ or $N$
for which the equality holds is the *signal period*. The sinusoidal signal we
saw earlier is periodic because of the $\mod 2\pi$ property of cosines. The
signal of the sinusoid has period 0.5 seconds (s), which turns out to be the
reciprocal of the frequency ￼ $1/f_0$￼ ￼ Hz.

*Matlab*

```matlab
%% A Periodic signal (square wave)
t = linspace(0, 1, 500);
plot(t, square(2 * pi * 5 * t));

xlabel('Time t (s)')
ylabel('Amplitude')
```

## Question

For the example we started with $x(t) = 2 \cos (2\pi \cdot 2 \cdot t + 3\pi/4)$.
Say we sample the cosine wave at 20 times the frequency, what would the sampling
period be and what would $N$ be for the sampled waveform?



## Write down your answer in the note area

## Aperiodic  

Signals that are *deterministic* (completely determined functions of time) but
not periodic are known as *aperiodic*. Point of view matters. If a signal occurs
infrequently, you may view it as aperiodic.

----

![An aperiodic function](pictures/pulse.png)

----

This is how we generate this aperiodic
rectangular pulse of duration $\tau$ in Matlab:

*Matlab*
```matlab
%% An aperiodic function
tau = 1
x = linspace(-1,5,1000);
y = rectangularPulse(0,tau,x);
plot(x,y)
ylim([-0.2,1.2])
grid
title('An Aperiodic Signal')
xlabel('Time t (s)')
ylabel('Amplitude')
```

See [aperiodic.m](https://github.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/blob/master/introduction/matlab/aperiodic.m)

## Random

A signal is random if one or more signal attributes takes on unpredictable
values in a probability sense.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
Engineers working with communication receivers are concerned with random
signals, especially noise.

----

*Matlab*

```matlab
%% Plot a Random Signal
plot(0.5 + 0.25 * rand(100,1))
ylim([0,1])
grid
title('Random Signal')
xlabel('Time t (s)')
ylabel('Amplitude')
```

## Domains for Signals and Systems

Most of the signals we encounter on a daily basis reside in the time domain.
They’re functions of independent variable $t$ or $n$. But sometimes when you’re
working with continuous-time signals, you may need to transform away from the
time domain ($t$) to either the frequency domain ($f$ or $\omega$) or the
[Laplace] $s$-domain ($s$). Similarly, for discrete-time signals, you may need
to transform from the discrete-time domain ($n$) to the frequency domain
($\hat{\omega}$￼) or the z-domain ($z$).

Systems, continuous and discrete, can also be transformed to the frequency and
s- and z-domains, respectively. Signals can, in fact, be passed through systems
in these alternative domains. When a signal is passed through a system in the
frequency domain, for example, the frequency domain output signal can later be
returned to the time domain and appear just as if the time- domain version of
the system operated on the signal in the time domain.

This section briefly introduces the world of signals and systems in the
frequency, s-, and z-domains. More on these domains will follow.

## Viewing Signals in the Frequency Domain

Consider the sum of a two-sinusoids signal
$$x(t) = \underbrace {A_1\cos(2\pi f_1 t)}_{s_1} + \underbrace {A_2\cos(2\pi f_2
t)}_{s_2}$$

----

![A two-sinusoids signal](pictures/twosines.png)

----

Matlab code: [two_sines.m](https://github.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/blob/master/introduction/matlab/two_sines.m)

(This example relies on
[arrow.m](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/278-arrow-m) by
Erik Johnson available from the Matlab File Exchange.)

<div class="notes">
The top waveform plot, denoted $s_1$, is a single sinusoid at frequency $f_1$
and peak amplitude $A_1$. The waveform repeats every period $T_1 = 1/f_1$. The
second waveform plot, denoted $s_2$, is a single sinusoid at frequency $f_2 >
f_1$ and peak amplitude $A_2 < A_1$. The sum signal, $s_1 + s_2$, in the time
domain is a squiggly line (third waveform plot), but the amplitudes and
frequencies (periods) of the sinusoids aren’t clear here as they are in the
first two plots. The frequency spectrum (bottom plot) reveals that $x(t)$ is
composed of just two sinusoids, with both the frequencies and amplitudes
discernible.

Think about tuning in a radio station. Stations are located at different center
frequencies. The stations don’t interfere with one another because they’re
separated from each other in the frequency domain. In the frequency spectrum
plot, imagine that $f_1$ and $f_2$ are the signals from two radio stations,
viewed in the frequency domain. You can design a receiving system to filter
$s_1$ from $s_1 + s_2$. The filter is designed to pass $s_1$ and block $s_2$.
</div>

## Fourier Transform

We use the *Fourier transform* to move away from the time domain and into the
frequency domain. To get back to the time domain, use the *inverse Fourier
transform*. We will find out more about these transforms in this module.

## Laplace and Z-Transform Domains

From the time domain to the frequency domain, only one independent variable, $t
\to f$, exists. When a signal is transformed to the *s*-domain, it becomes a
function of a complex variable ￼$s=\sigma + j\omega$. The two variables (real
and imaginary parts) describe a location in the *s*-plane.

In addition to visualization properties, the *s*-domain reduces differential
equation solving to algebraic manipulation. For discrete-time signals, the
*z*-transform accomplishes the same thing, except differential equations are
replaced by difference equations.

## Systems Thinking and Systems Design

See section **Testing Product Concepts with Behavioral Level Modeling** from
Chapter 1 of SS4D (pages 18--20) and summarize this for yourself.

* We will use *behavioural modelling*
* We will rely on *abstraction*
* We work *top-down*
* We make use of *mathematics* and *mathematical software*.

## Concluding Example: Some Basic Signal Operations

Consider a signal $f(t)$

$$x = f(t) = \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
{0\;:\;t <  - 1}\\
{t + 1\;:\; - 1 \le t \le 1}\\
{0\;:\;t > 1}
\end{array}} \right.$$
