    "## Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start today's lab you will need to download and install the **Fourier series demo app**, that was demonstrated in class, from Georgia Tech's [Educational Matlab GUIs](http://spfirst.gatech.edu/matlab) page.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install, visit the page and scroll down to find the Fourier Series Demo app (see image below)\n",
    "![Fourier Series Demo App](fsdemo.png)\n",
    "Right-click on the Blue Button labelled **FourierSeriesDemo** and save to your `lab06` folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "Open and run `fseriesdemo/fseriesdemo.m`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If MATLAB issues a message about the need to change the working directory or add a folder to the Matlab path. Accept the choice given.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spend some time playing with the settings and obderving the results. We will use this as a check of results of the labs to follow.\n",

    "## Lab Exercise 12: Computation of the coefficients of the Trig. Fourier Series\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab exercise we will review the Fourier series for a square wave with odd and even symmetry before going on to compute and plot the Fourier series for the *triangular* waveform.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also explore and confirm the stated results of even-, odd- and half-wave symmetries.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the script `trig_fseries.m` as a MATLAB Live Script. Run the script and read through the results. Note that the script calls the `TrigFourierSeries` function, defined in the file `TrigFourierSeries.m`, which in turn calls the `FourierSeries` function, defined in `FourierSeries.m`, to calculate the trigonometric Fourier series for the square wave with odd-symmetry. In other words, it reconstructs the $a_k$ and $b_k$ Coefficients from the exponential Fourier series coefficients $C_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the m-file `trig_fseries.m` as an MATLAB Live Script `ex12_1`. Change the script so that it computes and plots the trig. Fourier series for the square-wave waveform with even symmetry (Section 7.4.1 in the textbook).\n",
    " \n",
    "Note that the limits of the integration in `trig_fseries.m` start at 0, so you will need to construct the square wave over the period $[0, T]$ using unit step functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy the script `trig_fseries.m` and save it as `ex12_2`. Change the copy so that it computes and plots the trig. Fourier series for the Triangular waveform (Section 7.4.3 in the textbook).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 13: Simulating Wave Anaysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Downoad and open the Simulink model [fourier_example.slx](https://github.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/blob/master/portfolio/lab06/fourier_example.slx?raw=true). Examine the settings for the sine terms and compare the amplitudes and frequencies of the settings with the results of running `trig_fseries.m`. Run the simulation and view the reconstructed signal and the spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Change the settings so that the Simulink model uses the coefficients from the square-wave even-symmetry result. Simulate and capture the time and spectrum plots. Save your model as `ex13_1.slx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: Be careful to evaluate which set of coefficients are present in the Fourier series. Are they $a_k$ or $b_k$? What do you need to change in the sine wave generators to get the right results? \n",
    "\n",
    "Attach a screen capture of the spectrum plot and the Simulink model to the Lab 6 page in your lab portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Change the settings so that the Simulink model uses the coefficients from the triangular wave result. Simulate and capture the time and spectrum plots. Save your model as `ex13_2.slx`.\n",

    "## Lab Exercise 14: Computation of the coefficients of Exponential Fourier Series\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab exercise we will review the Fourier series for a square wave with odd and even symmetry before going on to compute and plot the Fourier series for the `triangular` waveform.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also explore and confirm the stated results of even-, odd- and half-wave symmetries.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Part 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Examine and run the script `exp_fseries.m`  (which calls the `FourierSeries` function defined in `TrigFourierSeries.m`) to calculate the exponential Fourier series for the square wave with odd-symmetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 7\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy the script `exp_fseries.m` and save it as `ex14_1`. Change the copy so that it computes and plots the exponential Fourier series for the square-wave waveform with even symmetry (Section 7.4.1 in the textbook). *Hint*: Use the same definition of f(t) that you used in Exercise 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the computed spectrum with the simulated spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 8\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy the script `exp_fseries.m` and save it as `ex14_2`. Change the copy so that it computes and plots the exponential Fourier series for the full-wave rectified sinusoidal waveform (**Note**: `f(t) = abs(sin(t))` (Section 7.4.5 in the textbook).\n",

    "\n",
    "## What to Hand In\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find it easiest to audit your completion of these exercises by opening the provided `*.m` files as Live Script files and saving them in this format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Marks will be awarded according to how many of the parts of Lab Exercises 12 to 14 have been completed.\n",
    "You should attach a PDF printout and copy of your MATLAB Live Scripts named `ex12_1`, `ex12_2`, `ex14_1`, `ex14_2`, copies of your Simulink models `ex13_1.slx` and `ex13_2.slx` plus screen shotq of the harmonic waveforms generated.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optional Additional Tasks: Review and Change the Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem with the scripts as provided is that the limits on the integrals are set in the range $[0, T]$. It would be convenient if this could be changed, for example when computing FS for even signals, the limits could be adjusted to $[-T/2,T/2]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In MATLAB we can achieve this by adding extra arguments to the function definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 9\n",
    "\n",
    "Examine the code for the `FourierSeries` function that is defined in `FourierSeries.m`. Adapt the function definition so that the user can define the range of the Fourier Series integral. If you succeed, use the modified function to compute the Fourier series of the triangular wave form by exploiting half-wave symmetry. Save the script that does this as `ex14_3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 10\n",
    "\n",
    "Examine the code that is defined in `TrigFourierSeries`. Note that it calls `FourierSeries` then computes `ak` and `bk` from the `Ck` coefficients. Why did I do that do you think? \n",
    "\n",
    "If you made the suggested change to `FourierSeries`, provide compatible changes to your copy of `TrigFourierSeries`. Test it on a square wave with even symmetry (Lab 13 Part 2). Save the resulting calling script as `ex12_3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute the FS of the half-wave rectified cosine function. Save the resulting calling script as `ex14_4`."
