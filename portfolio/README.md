# EG-247 Signals and Systems

## Lab Portfolio

This part of the repository contains a template for the EG-247 lab portfolio.

The directory structure follows the structure recommended in the [marking
scheme](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zBK_d1xMYvOQXlUZyGBjb9WrfZukVC6MbsXH-zSES8k/edit?usp=sharing) and the folders contain copies of the starter files needed for
each lab exercise and empty files for those documents that you are
expected to contribute yourself.
