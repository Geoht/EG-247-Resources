# Lab 3: Laplace and Inverse Laplace Transforms

These examples have been adapted from Chapters 1, 2 and 3 of Stephen Karris, [Signals and Systems : With MATLAB Computing and Simulink Modeling (5th Edition)](http://site.ebrary.com/lib/swansea/docDetail.action?docID=10547416).

## Lab Exercise 5: Laplace Transforms

Follow the link above to download the ``laplace_lab.m`` script from this repository. Open the script as a Live Script and use the Matlab ``laplace`` and ``ezplot`` functions as appropriate to complete the examples given in the comments in the script.

Save and attach the resulting modified script ``laplace_lab`` as a Live Script file as well as a print out as a PDF file to page **Lab 3: Laplace and Inverse Laplace Transforms** of your OneNote portfolio.

## What to Hand In

Marks should be be claimed according to how many of the parts of Exercises 5 and 6 have been completed.

See [Assessment and Feedback: Labwork Assessment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zBK_d1xMYvOQXlUZyGBjb9WrfZukVC6MbsXH-zSES8k/edit?usp=sharing) for a detailed marking scheme.

## Doing More?

If you have time remaining, you may wish to work through Appendix B of the textbook. That chapter introduces Simulunk in a way that matches the presentation in the rest of the book.
