# Lab 3: Laplace and Inverse Laplace Transforms

These examples have been adapted from Chapters 1, 2 and 3 of Stephen Karris, [Signals and Systems : With MATLAB Computing and Simulink Modeling (5th Edition)](http://site.ebrary.com/lib/swansea/docDetail.action?docID=10547416).

## Lab Exercise 5: Laplace Transforms

Follow the link to download and publish the ``laplace_lab.m`` script from this repository. Use the Matlab ``laplace`` and ``ezplot`` functions as appropriate to complete the examples given in the comments in the script.

Save and add the resulting modified script ``laplace_lab.m`` to folder ``lab2`` of your portfolio.

## Lab Exercise 6: Inverse Laplace Transforms

Follow the link to download and publish the ``ilaplace_lab.m`` script from this repository. Use the Matlab ``laplace``, ``ilaplace`` and ``ezplot`` functions as appropriate to complete the examples given in the comments in the script.

Save and add the resulting modified script ``ilaplace_lab.m`` to folder ``lab2`` of your portfolio.

## What to Hand In

Marks will be awarded according to how many of the parts of Exercises 3 and 4 have been completed.

See [Assessment and Feedback: Labwork Assessment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17VCWrwHpfx0W_7FX3MYB2HhddwgdbblUVdUNoLSwECQ/edit?usp=sharing) for a detailed marking scheme.

You will find it easiest to audit your completion of the Laplace and inverse Laplace exercises by publishing the scripts using the **Publish** option in the m-file editor. I do not require you to add the published document in your portfolio as I will regenerate this when I validate your claim.

## Doing More?

If you have time remaining, you may wish to work through Appendix B of the textbook. That chapter introduces Simulunk in a way that matches the presentation in the rest of the book.
