# Lab 2: Elementary Signals

These examples have been adapted from Chapter 1 of
[Stephen Karris, Signals and Systems : With MATLAB
Computing and Simulink Modeling (5th Edition)](http://site.ebrary.com/lib/swansea/docDetail.action?docID=10547416)

## Lab Exercise 3

In this exercise we will explore the use of the ``heaviside`` and ``dirac`` functions and how they can be used in the synthesis of elementary signals.

File: [elem_sigs.m](https://github.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/blob/master/portfolio/lab1/elem_sigs.m)

For Lab Exercise 6 you are required to complete parts 1 to 2 of the provided script (1 mark).

## Lab Exercise 4

For Lab Exercise 7 you are required to complete parts 3 to 5 of the provided script (2 marks).

## Mini Project 2

Work through the procedures given between pages 1-18 and 1-19 of the text book to construct the piecewise signal generator first shown in Figure 1.21 inside Simulink. Connect the signal up a derivative block and scope as shown in Figure 1.24 and simulate the system. Verify the result illustrated in Figures 1.23, 1.25 and 1.26. Store the Simulink model as ``signal.slx`` in your portfolio for later assessment. (2 marks)

## What to Hand In

You should add your modified version of the file ``elem_signals.m`` in folder ``lab02`` of your EG-247 portfolio. Marks can be claimed according to how many of parts 1-5 in the script have been completed and for the Simulink model of the piecewise linear signal ``signal.slx``.

See [Assessment and Feedback: Labwork Assessment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17VCWrwHpfx0W_7FX3MYB2HhddwgdbblUVdUNoLSwECQ/edit?usp=sharing) for a detailed marking scheme.

You will find it easiest to audit your completion of Exercise 6 by publishing the result using the **Publish** option in the m-file editor. I do not require you to add the published document in your portfolio as I will regenerate this when I validate your claim.


## Doing More

If you have time remaining, you may wish to work through Appendix A of the textbook. This chapters introduce Matlab in a way that matches the presentation in the rest of the book. There are also additional tutorial and video introductions to *Matlab*, *Simulink* and the *Signal Processing Toolbox* in the **Getting Started with Matlab** folder in the Labs section of the Blackboard site for EG-247.
