    "# Lab 5: Convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "## Acknowledgements\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples have been adapted from Chapter 6 of <a href=\"http://site.ebrary.com/lib/swansea/docDetail.action?docID=10547416\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen Karris, Signals and Systems : With MATLAB Computing and Simulink Modeling (5th Edition)</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matlab/Simulink Concepts Introduced\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explore convolution with the aid of an interactive MATLAB \"app\"\n",
    "* Use the `int` and `heaviside` functions from the **Symbolic Toolbox** to perform symbolic computation of convolution integrals.\n",
    "* Use `laplace` and `ilaplace` to solve convolution problems.\n",
    "* Use `ezplot` to plot symbolic functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start today's lab you will need to download and install the <a href=\"https://github.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/blob/master/week4/matlab/convolutiondemo.m\" target=\"_blank\">Graphical demonstration of convolution app</a> from the resources notes for Week 4 ([github.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/week4/matlab](https://github.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/tree/master/week4/matlab)).\n",
    "\n",
    "To install, right-click button of link as appropriate and save as to your `lab05` folder. Double click the downloaded zip files to unpack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open and run `convolutiondemo.m`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If MATLAB issues a message about the need to change the working directory or add a folder to the MATLAB path. Accept the choice given.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Exercise 10: Graphical Demonstration of Convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab exercise we will use the `convolutiondemo` app demonstrated in class as an aid to understanding and setting up the convolution integral for various systems including the step-response of an RL circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Set up the `convolutiondemo` app as described in the notes for the computation of the Convolution Integral for Example 6.4 from the textbook illustrated below. (Refer to Example 2 in [Week 4](http://cpjobling.github.io/EG-247-Resources/week4/convolution.ipynb) for the Matlab settings).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Example 6.4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/master/portfolio/lab05/2014-03-03_1228.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the tool to confirm the convolution result given by this Matlab script: <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/master/portfolio/lab05/exercise10.m\" target=\"_blank\">exercise10.m</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the script <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/master/portfolio/lab05/exercise10.m\" target=\"_blank\">exercise10.m</a> as a model. Use the `convolutiondemo` tool as an aid to defining the integration limits needed to find and plot the convolution integral for the example shown below (Example 6.5 from the textbook).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Example 6.5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/master/portfolio/lab05/2014-03-03_1240.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat the procedure for example 6.6 from the textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Example 6.6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpjobling/EG-247-Resources/master/portfolio/lab05/2014-03-03_1246.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Adapt your procedure to determine the step response of the RC circuit given as Example 6.7 in the textbook.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Lab Exercise 11: Using Laplace to Solve Convolution Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab exercise we will demonstrate that time-convolution of a system response can be solved in the complex frequency domain using Laplace and Inverse Laplace transforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the inverse Laplace transform function `ilaplace` to solve the step response of the RC circuit given in exercise 10 without convolution. You will need the Laplace transform of the circuit's impulse response $h(t)$ and the unit step $u_0(t)$ (Matlab `heaviside`).\n",
    "* Plot the result using `ezplot`\n",
    "* Confirm the result with a simulink simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to hand in\n",
    "\n",
    "You should save your modified version of the file as `example10.m` in folder `lab05` of your EG-247 portfolio as `ex11_1`. Additional marks will be awarded according to how many of Exercises 10 (Parts 2-4) and 11 have been completed. Name each solution according to the exercise and part number: e.g. Exercise 10 scripts should be named `ex10_2`, `ex10_3` etc. Use the same naming scheme for any Simulink models submitted for assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "See <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zBK_d1xMYvOQXlUZyGBjb9WrfZukVC6MbsXH-zSES8k/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Assessment and Feedback: Labwork Assessment</strong></a> for a detailed marking scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find it easiest to audit your completion of these exercises by opening the provided `*.m` files as Live Script files and saving them in this format."
